There is a locale bug in GNU Radio. It fails with a whole bunch of these errors:

  locale::facet::_S_create_c_locale name not valid

Fixed it by setting:

  export LC_ALL="C"
  export LANG="C"
  export LANGUAGE="C"

Not sure which were actually needed. Maybe only LC_ALL, but easy to test by unsetting some.

Correct error might be an arm specific code fix in libboost. See here for inspiration:
